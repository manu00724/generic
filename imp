Perfect. Below are two deliverables you can directly use in a bank / enterprise review:

1️⃣ Security Review Checklist (for InfoSec / Architecture sign-off)
2️⃣ 1-Page PRD Diagram (Textual + Diagram-ready)

Both are implementation-aligned with what you designed, not generic theory.

1️⃣ Security Review Checklist (Bank / Regulated-Grade)

You can literally paste this into a Security Review / Threat Model doc.


---

A. Authentication & Authorization

✅ Identity Ownership

[ ] Host platform is the single source of truth for user identity

[ ] No user credentials stored or handled by BG system

[ ] Platform token is never exposed to frontend


✅ BG-Scoped Authorization

[ ] BG Session Token is scoped to single BG reference

[ ] Token contains bg_ref, winame, requestId

[ ] Token cannot be reused for another BG


✅ Token Hygiene

[ ] Short-lived token (≤ 15 minutes)

[ ] Token revoked on submit / cancel

[ ] Replay protection via jti



---

B. API Security

✅ Ingress Validation

[ ] All backend APIs require BG session token

[ ] Token validated on every request

[ ] Missing / invalid token returns 401


✅ Authorization Checks

[ ] BG_READ enforced for fetch APIs

[ ] BG_WRITE enforced for submit API

[ ] Scope escalation not possible


✅ Platform Trust Boundary

[ ] Platform token validated server-side only

[ ] No platform secrets stored in frontend

[ ] Optional callback validation supported



---

C. Data Protection

✅ Data in Transit

[ ] TLS 1.2+ enforced end-to-end

[ ] No plaintext BG data in headers

[ ] BG text only sent in request body


✅ Data at Rest

[ ] BG drafts encrypted at rest (if stored)

[ ] Final BG text stored with checksum / hash

[ ] No raw BG stored in logs



---

D. Session & State Management

✅ Session Control

[ ] Session bound to sessionID

[ ] Multiple tabs handled safely

[ ] Stale sessions rejected


✅ Duplicate Protection

[ ] Submit API is idempotent

[ ] Duplicate submit returns 409

[ ] BG state locked after submission



---

E. Logging & Audit

✅ Audit Trail

[ ] Token issuance logged

[ ] BG submit logged with timestamp

[ ] User + BG reference captured


✅ Secure Logging

[ ] No tokens logged

[ ] No BG text logged

[ ] Error logs sanitized



---

F. Error Handling

✅ Safe Error Responses

[ ] No internal stack traces exposed

[ ] Business errors mapped to codes

[ ] Security errors generic (Unauthorized, not “JWT expired at…”)



---

G. Compliance & Review

[ ] OWASP API Top 10 reviewed

[ ] Pen-test ready endpoints identified

[ ] Secrets rotated via vault / env vars

[ ] Architecture approved by platform team



---

✅ Security Review Verdict

> BG system follows least privilege, short-lived authorization, and clear trust boundaries.

2️⃣ 1-Page PRD Diagram (Architecture + Flow)

This is PRD / Confluence / PPT ready.


---

Title

Bank Guarantee (BG) Vetting – Secure Micro-Frontend Integration


---

Objective

Integrate BG vetting as a secure, auditable micro-frontend within the host platform journey, without duplicating authentication or journey orchestration.


---

Actors

Host Platform – Identity & Journey Owner

BG Auth Service – Authorization Gateway

BG Backend – Processing & Validation

BG Frontend – BG Review & Edit UI

 Next Journey Screen

End-to-End Flow (Condensed)

1. User initiates BG vetting from host platform


2. Host platform authenticates and issues platform token


3. BG Auth Service validates request and issues BG session token


4. BG frontend loads and fetches BG data via BG backend


5. User reviews / edits BG


6. On submit, BG backend validates token and forwards BG text


7. Host platform advances journey to next screen




---

Security Design Principles

Identity owned by host platform

Authorization scoped per BG

Short-lived, revocable tokens

Zero trust between frontend and backend

Full auditability



---

Success Metrics (Optional but Strong)

0 unauthorized BG submissions

<15 min session expiry enforcement

100% submit idempotency

Zero credential leakage incidents



---

Out of Scope

User login / password management

Journey navigation control

Platform authentication logic



---

Final One-Liner (Exec Friendly)

> “The BG vetting solution integrates as a secure, BG-scoped micro-frontend using short-lived authorization tokens, while identity and journey orchestration remain with the host platform.”




---

If you want next, I can:

Convert this directly into PPT (6–8 slides)

Create a Security Q&A sheet for InfoSec

Draft a platform onboarding checklist

Produce a sequence diagram image (draw.io / Mermaid)


Just say the word 👍
