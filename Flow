Great, this will round off the integration pack nicely. Below are two concrete deliverables you can directly hand to the platform team.


---

1️⃣ Platform Onboarding Checklist (Host Platform → BG System)

This checklist is platform-facing (what they must configure / agree to before go-live).


---

A. Commercial & Ownership Alignment

[ ] BG system identified as micro-frontend / external capability

[ ] Host platform confirmed as identity & journey owner

[ ] BG system confirmed as authorization-only (no login)



---

B. Authentication & Trust Setup

Platform → BG Auth Service

[ ] Client credentials issued (client_id, client_secret)

[ ] Token audience (aud) agreed (e.g. bg-backend)

[ ] Token signing algorithm agreed (HS256 / RS256)

[ ] Token introspection / validation mechanism agreed


Network Trust

[ ] IP allowlist configured (if required)

[ ] Mutual TLS decision documented (optional)

[ ] TLS version ≥ 1.2 confirmed



---

C. API Contract Finalization

Required APIs

[ ] /token (Platform OAuth)

[ ] /getVetted (Journey → BG entry)

[ ] /submit (BG exit → next screen)


Mandatory Fields (No Renaming Allowed)

[ ] winame

[ ] bgreferencenumber

[ ] requestId

[ ] sessionID

[ ] requestingapp

[ ] producttype = BG

[ ] subproducttype = NBG



---

D. Journey Orchestration

[ ] getVetted mapped to BG Vetting step

[ ] Submit API mapped to next journey screen

[ ] Duplicate submit handling defined (409 expected)

[ ] Cancel / timeout behavior documented



---

E. Frontend Embedding

[ ] Embedding mode confirmed (iframe / redirect)

[ ] Token never exposed via URL params

[ ] Context passed via secure payload

[ ] Cross-origin policy agreed (CORS)



---

F. Error Handling Agreement

Scenario	Expected

Token expired	Platform re-initiates getVetted
Duplicate submit	Platform blocks navigation
BG mismatch	Platform shows generic error
Host submit failure	Retry / manual fallback


[ ] Error codes mapped between systems

[ ] No internal error messages exposed to user



---

G. Audit & Compliance

[ ] BG reference included in all logs

[ ] User ID propagated (masked if needed)

[ ] Submit timestamp captured

[ ] Retention policy agreed



---

H. Pre-Go-Live Validation

[ ] End-to-end UAT completed

[ ] Token expiry tested

[ ] Replay attack tested

[ ] Multiple tabs scenario tested

[ ] Pen-test signoff (if required)



---

✅ Platform Onboarding Exit Criteria

> Platform can safely launch BG vetting with zero identity duplication and full audit compliance.

2️⃣ Sequence Diagram Image (Architecture-Accurate)

Below is a diagram-ready sequence representation.
You can recreate this as-is in draw.io, Lucid, or Mermaid.

Sequence Diagram (Authoritative Flow)

User
 |
 | Clicks "BG Vetting"
 v
Host UI
 |
 | getVetted (BG context)
 v
Host Backend
 |
 | POST /token
 v
Platform Auth Server
 |
 | access_token
 v
Host Backend
 |
 | POST /auth/verify
 | (platform token + BG context)
 v
BG Auth Service
 |
 | Validate platform token
 | Validate BG state
 |
 | Issue BG session token
 v
BG Frontend
 |
 | GET BG data
 | Authorization: BG session token
 v
BG Backend
 |
 | Validate BG token
 | Populate BG text
 v
BG Frontend
 |
 | User edits BG
 |
 | Submit
 v
BG Backend
 |
 | Validate BG_WRITE scope
 | Revoke token
 |
 | POST Submit API (BG text)
 v
Host Submit API
 |
 | OK
 v
Next Journey Screen


---

Notes for Diagram Review (Important)

Token exchange never touches browser storage

Platform token and BG token are never mixed

Journey advancement happens only via Submit API

BG Auth Service is a trust gate, not identity provider



---

Final Packaging Tip (PM-to-PM)

If you’re sending this to the platform team, bundle as:

1. 1-page PRD diagram


2. Platform onboarding checklist


3. Security checklist



That combination answers:

“Is this secure?”

“Who owns what?”

“How do we onboard without risk?”



---

If you want next, I can:

Convert the sequence into Mermaid syntax

Create a PPT slide with this diagram

Write a platform kickoff email

Prepare InfoSec Q&A (typical bank questions)


Just tell me 👍
